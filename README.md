## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthickag04/learn_javascript.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any topic folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) → Console to see JavaScript output.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each topic folder contains:
```
XX-topic-name/
├── index.html      # HTML file to run in browser
└── js/
    └── script.js   # JavaScript with detailed comments
```

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Read the HTML file** - Provides topic overview and reference tables
2. **Open in browser** - See interactive elements and console output
3. **Study the JavaScript** - Well-commented code explains each concept
4. **Experiment** - Modify the code and see the results
